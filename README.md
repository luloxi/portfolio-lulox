# Personal Portfolio Website

Made with love using Next.js, TypeScript and ChakraUI.

## Pending changes

### General

Take note of portfolios mentioned in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMp8l4WEpE) to make improvements to mine.

### Visual

- Add button to switch language (eng/esp)
- [Add a timeline and programming languages section](https://dev.to/m_ahmad/create-professional-portfolio-website-with-nextjs-and-chakraui-4lkn)

### Security

- Make EmailJs variables private (is it possible? Or should I switch to a better mailing system?)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
