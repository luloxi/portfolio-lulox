# Personal Portfolio Website

Made with love using Next.js, TypeScript and ChakraUI.

## Pending changes

### General

- Add more repos (and websites!) to Projects tab
- Take note of portfolios mentioned in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMp8l4WEpE) to make improvements to mine.
- View [this junior portfolio](https://winter-art-7889.on.fleek.co/) and use as reference [(GitHub here)](https://github.com/jdhorth/web3-portfolio)

### Visual

- Add button to switch language (eng/esp)
- [Add a timeline and programming languages section](https://dev.to/m_ahmad/create-professional-portfolio-website-with-nextjs-and-chakraui-4lkn)

### Security

- Make EmailJs variables private (is it possible? Or should I switch to a better mailing system?)
